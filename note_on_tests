Must test with smol >= 0.0.8 and sparce-lm >= 0.2.1

Devop plan as per week 9/20/22
1, Re-write everything into jobflows form.
2, Rewrite handling as functions; remove things unless absolutely necessary; crate pre-sets.
3, Add helper function in data_wrangler to parse
   atomate2 taskdoc into ComputedStructureEntry; (Do we really need such a wrangler here??)
4, Another data storage wrangler to store all past
   generated structures (not necessarily successful
   training data.)
5, Write fitter class.
6, Writer convergence checker class.

Next week:
3, begin production tests.
