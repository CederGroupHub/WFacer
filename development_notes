You must test with smol >= 0.0.8 and sparce-lm >= 0.2.1

Devop plan:
1, Re-write a single jobflow maker to connect up everything.
2, Do not need another data storage wrangler to store all past
   generated structures, just using a list in jobflow data is enough.
3, begin production tests. (Begin ASAP, Finish after holidays.)
4, Begin pytest writing for modules and jobflow generation. (Begin after holidays.)
5, Begin docs writing. (Begin after holidays)
