You must test with smol >= 0.0.8 and sparce-lm >= 0.2.1

Devop plan:
1, Re-write a single jobflow maker to connect up everything.
2, Add helper function in data_wrangler to parse
   atomate2 taskdoc into ComputedStructureEntry; (Do we really need such a wrangler here??);
   Another data storage wrangler to store all past
   generated structures (not necessarily successful
   training data.)
3, Write fitting functions.
4, Write convergence check functions.
5, begin production tests. (Begin ASAP, Finish after holidays.)
6, Begin pytest writing for modules and jobflow generation. (Begin after holidays.)
7, Begin docs writing. (Begin after holidays)
